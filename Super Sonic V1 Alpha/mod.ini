Title="Super/Hyper Sonic Ultimate DX"
Version="5.1"
Description="**Epilepsy Warning:** \nThis mod contains content that's not suitable for those who are sensitive to sudden movement, flashing lights, or flashing colors.  If you meet any of this criteria, please refrain from using this mod, or use the config options to disable content that you may be sensitive to.\n\nI'm aware that depending on the config, there is a chance that the parry section of the final boss will crash the game. In some cases, going to another map first, then going into another story can fix this, otherwise, you'll need to just let the boss do his thing to avoid the crash.  I'm still researching the cause of this.\n\n \nPlease note that for this mods color changing to work correctly, you'll need a decently powerful computer and you might need to toggle full screen mode.  Also, codes that push the fps past 60 may break the cycle, so I don't recommend an unlocked framerate for gameplay, but unlocking it during cutscenes may be necessary for color changing to work correctly in cutscenes.  Additionally, due to the nature of this mods customization I can't guarantee compatibility with most other mods.\n\nThis mod allows you to freely choose between Super and Hyper Sonic across base, Super, and the Super Sonic 2 transformation!  This update features additional overall polish, more customization options, and a bunch of bugfixes.  Additional features I have intending on implementing for awhile now have also been added, hence the "DX" in the name.\n\nHighlights:\n-Super/Hyper transformations\n-Alternate costumes\n-Spindash support\n-Custom physics\n-Custom animations\n-Multiple auras to choose from for Hyper Sonic\n-Customizable eye colors for Hyper Sonic\n-Other stuff I might've forgot about\n- Color changing Hyper Sonic\n- Hyper Sonic playable in open zone\n- Super/Hyper Sonic 2 transformation\n- 2 trails to choose from, both interchangeable.\n- Improved invincibility, now damages enemies\n- Hyper Flash, see readme\n- Super/Hyper Stomp, see readme\n- Super/Hyper Spin Dash, see readme\n- Chaos Meteor/Chaos Blast, see readme\n- Diving out of falling animation is now possible by pressing the Y button\n- Explosive Boost, see readme\n\n- I probably forgot about other things.\n\nBase form flight controls:\n\n________________________________\n\nTo enable base form flight, jump and click the left stick in.\n\nAs of the latest update, restoring ground movement should be autonomous, and no longer require specific user input.  This solution is not perfect, so it's possible that in some situations, ground movement may not behave as expected.  While unlikely, please let me know if any issues come up, and I'll take a look.\n\nTo adjust elevation, press and hold RT/R2, turn the left analog stick in any direction, then press the A/Cross button to fly up.  This can only be done once after each time you're not grounded.\n\nIf you intend on using anything from this mod for anything that you plan on posting online, please contact me first and provide credit.  Modding takes a lot of time and effort, so providing proper credit is very important to me."
