- Major changes to flight.  Overall more polished with proper animations and issues with random hovering have been fixed.

## Super/Hyper Sonic Ultimate - Hyper Sonic Combat Update Rev 4.1
-  Removed problematic particles for all transformations.  This prevents a problem where when you transform, certain particles will stack, such as gpu particles or lightning effects.

## Super/Hyper Sonic Ultimate - Hyper Sonic Combat Update Rev 4
-  Revamped how Chaos Meteor works.  Chaos Meteor now activates by holding in both triggers, while Chaos Blast will activate when either trigger is let go.
-  Revamped the particle effects that play when the particle trail selection is enabled.  This now creates an aura that surrounds Sonic, and can be toggeled on/off in-game, complete with fine tuning the intensity of the aura itself.  It is off by default.  To adjust the intensity, hold Y and press dpad up/down.
-  Toned down the effects that play during explosive boost.
-  Other small adjustments.

## Super/Hyper Sonic Ultimate - Hyper Sonic Combat Update Rev 3.1

## Super/Hyper Sonic Ultimate - Hyper Sonic Combat Update Rev 2

-  Fixed an oversight that prevented open world base flight from working with open world Hyper Sonic.

- A previous update broke invincibility.  This update fixes it.
- There's an issue that sometimes prevents SS2 from using the correct aura in certain cutscenes and gameplay, along with SS to a lesser degree (in terms of cutscenes only).  The SS aura issues should be fixed now, but the SS2 aura still needs more work done.

- Fixed an issue where Hyper Sonic's stomp couldn't defeat the spring enemies in Ares.

- The colorful aura for Hyper Sonic has been updated.  There is also a new star aura for Hyper Sonic.

- Added A LOT of custom animations.

- Quills now move for most models.  Any don't don't move have clipping issues that I plan on sorting out later.

- Overall updated visuals for Super and Hyper Sonic.  All models have an outline aura and base form Super Sonic now has an aura when the Phantom Rush is enabled.

- Physics and combat has been completely revamped.  Special moves are now overall quicker for both Super and Hyper Sonic.  Hyper Sonic's speed has also been increased a bit.

- Eye customization is now possible within HMM, so no more running a batch script to change Hyper Sonic's eye color.

- I implemented some HMM codes to help enhance gameplay.  These codes can also be turned off entirely if you prefer.

- Flying no longer has a pre-determined horizontal and vertical speed.  Flight speed is now determined based on your air momentum while moving through the air.

- Cyberspace stages should now feel better and be much more playable.

- Rail grinding is now faster in order to compliment the updated flight.

- Base Sonic and Super Sonic have been added back into Faithful.  This also depreciates Hyper Sonic Faithful standalone, which will no longer be updated.

## Super/Hyper Sonic Faithful 2.6.6 Hotfix
- Fixed a bug with the eye texture swapping batch file that breaks compatibility on some computers.

## Super/Hyper Sonic Faithful 2.6.5
- Fixed eyes on all 17(?) models.  Previously, the eyes would not move due to incorrect names being used.

- Aura outline added to Hyper Sonic.

- The colorful aura has been adjusted to be consistent between each fight, representative of the Giganto and Supreme boss fights.

- Support for eye customization has been added for Hyper Sonic.  The available colors are cyan, magenta, blue and red.  To change eye colors, open the run_to_change_eye_colors.bat batch file and follow the prompt on-screen.

- File size has been reduced due to a ton of duplicate files being included in the last release.  This was due to some unknowns during that time and these files are no longer needed.  Files that are not needed in some .pac files have also been deleted.  There's still room for space to be saved in the future.

- Grinding animations for all models have been reverted back to vanilla.  This was orignially changed due to the broken nature of early released.  Since the broken animations are no longer an issue, the flying animation band-aid is no longer needed.
